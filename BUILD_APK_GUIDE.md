# 🚀 BUILD YOUR APK - Complete Step-by-Step Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Where to Run These Commands

**You MUST run these commands from YOUR computer/terminal**, not in this chat!

Why? Because:
- EAS Build requires your Expo account login
- Authentication can only be done by you
- Builds happen on Expo's cloud servers

---

## 📋 Prerequisites (5 minutes)

### 1. Create Expo Account (FREE)
- Go to: **https://expo.dev/signup**
- Sign up with email
- Verify your email
- **No credit card required!**

### 2. Have Access to Your Terminal
- **Windows**: Use Command Prompt or PowerShell
- **Mac/Linux**: Use Terminal
- **Or**: Use the terminal in this Emergent environment

---

## 🎯 BUILD PROCESS (3 Simple Commands)

### **Command 1: Login to Expo**
```bash
cd /app/frontend
npx eas login
```

**What will happen:**
- You'll be asked for email and password
- Enter your Expo account credentials
- You'll see: "Logged in as [your-email]"

---

### **Command 2: Configure Project**
```bash
npx eas build:configure
```

**What will happen:**
- You'll be asked: "Would you like to create a project?" → Press **Y**
- You'll be asked: "Generate new Android Keystore?" → Press **Y**
- You'll see: "Project configured successfully"

**⏱️ Time: 1-2 minutes**

---

### **Command 3: Build Production AAB (for Play Store)**
```bash
npx eas build --platform android --profile production
```

**What will happen:**
1. Code is uploaded to Expo servers
2. Build starts in the cloud
3. You get a build URL to track progress
4. You'll receive email when complete (~15 minutes)

**⏱️ Time: 10-15 minutes**

---

## 📱 OPTIONAL: Build Preview APK First (Recommended!)

**Before building for Play Store, test with preview APK:**

```bash
npx eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

**Why?**
- Creates APK (easy to install and test)
- Test on your phone before Play Store submission
- Same 10-15 minute build time
- FREE (counts from your 30 builds/month)

**Recommended Flow:**
1. Build preview APK → Test → If good →
2. Build production AAB → Submit to Play Store

---

## 🎯 EXACT COMMANDS TO RUN (Copy-Paste Ready)

Open your terminal and run these one by one:

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to frontend folder
cd /app/frontend

# Step 2: Login
npx eas login

# Step 3: Configure (first time only)
npx eas build:configure

# Step 4: Build preview APK for testing
npx eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Step 5: After testing, build production AAB

```
