The AI engineer's trajectory details significant development and deployment work for The Divine Cakery application. Initial efforts focused on debugging and deploying a Product Bulk Upload feature, which involved re-uploading files, creating a Python script, fixing API endpoints, and resolving authentication issues. Following this, the preparation list report was updated to filter by ordered quantity. A major phase involved preparing and troubleshooting Google Play Store builds, leading to the discovery of a critical backend URL misconfiguration in the mobile app. This prompted the deployment of the FastAPI backend to Render.com, a process fraught with challenges including GitHub authentication issues (requiring PAT), and Render build failures due to Python versioning and memory limitations (common on free tier). The app icon was also resized for the Play Store while preserving the login page logo. The current state involves troubleshooting backend connectivity (502 errors) from the live mobile app due to Render's free tier inactivity.

<product_requirements>
The Divine Cakery is a full-stack mobile and web platform for wholesale bakery customers and administrators, designed for streamlined operations with a polished, native user experience. It features role-based access, multi-category product support, sequential order numbers, dynamic delivery/status tracking, and Razorpay integration (test mode). Recent work included UI/UX refinements, Dual-Login for Owner/Order Agent roles, and critical backend data integrity migrations. The overarching goal is Google Play Store deployment. User requests involved refining admin reports (preparation list filtering), updating the app icon (separate from login logo), implementing Standing Orders (auto-generation, override logic), and a product bulk upload feature (with provided Excel and images).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was troubleshooting a critical issue: the Google Play Store live app (Build 28) was unable to load products and stock pages, which the user reported. Upon investigation, the AI confirmed that the backend () was returning a  error. This is a recurring problem attributed to Render.com's free tier, which spins down services due to inactivity and has limited memory, leading to restarts and temporary unavailability. The AI's last action was to attempt to check and wake up the backend, acknowledging the likely cause is the free tier's resource limitations.
