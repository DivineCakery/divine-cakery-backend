# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Login with:
   - Username: `DivineCakery`
   - Password: `Tunak/kk2$`

3. Fill in repository details:
   - Repository name: `divine-cakery-backend`
   - Description: `FastAPI backend for Divine Cakery mobile app`
   - Visibility: **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
   - ✅ Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

4. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Get Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you the repository URL. It will be:
```
https://github.com/DivineCakery/divine-cakery-backend.git
```

## Step 3: Share with Me

Once you've created the repository, let me know and I'll:
1. Push the backend code to GitHub
2. Connect it to Render.com
3. Deploy automatically

## Alternative: Create Personal Access Token

If you prefer automated push, create a token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Note: `Render Deployment`
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click **"Generate token"**
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)
7. Share the token with me

Then I can push code automatically!

2. Connect to Render.com
