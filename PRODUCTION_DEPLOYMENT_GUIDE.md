## 📍 WHERE TO FIND THE DEPLOY BUTTON

### **In Emergent Interface:**

2. You should see a **"Deploy"** button (usually blue/green)
3. It may also be in:
   - Project settings menu
   - Deployment tab
   - Actions dropdown menu

### **Alternative Locations:**
- Left sidebar → "Deployments" section
- Top navigation → "Deploy" or "Production"
- Project menu (three dots) → "Deploy to Production"

---

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **Step 1: Click Deploy Button**
- Look for "Deploy" or "Deploy to Production"
- Click it

### **Step 2: Review Deployment Settings**
You'll see a deployment configuration screen with:

#### **Environment Variables to Verify:**
```
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
DB_NAME=divine_cakery
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_RWMdSO0IeFPkBy
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://sweet-orders-8.preview.emergentagent.com
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: 
- If you see "RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_..." you're in TEST mode
- For production, you'll need LIVE Razorpay keys
- For now, TEST mode is fine for initial deployment

#### **Secrets to Keep Secure:**
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` (if you have it)
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` (email notifications)
- Any API keys

### **Step 3: Configure Deployment**
- **Name**: divine-cakery-production
- **Branch**: main (or your current branch)
- **Auto-deploy**: Optional (recommended ON)
- **Region**: Choose closest to your users (India/Asia if applicable)

### **Step 4: Confirm Deployment**
- Review all settings
- Click "Deploy" or "Confirm"
- Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment to complete

### **Step 5: Get Your Production URL**
After deployment completes, you'll get:
```
Production URL: https://divine-cakery-production.emergent.sh
OR
Custom URL: https://bakery-admin-5.emergentagent.com
```

## 🔧 WHAT HAPPENS DURING DEPLOYMENT

1. **Code is packaged** (backend + frontend + database config)
2. **Services are started** (FastAPI, MongoDB, Expo)
3. **SSL certificate** is automatically provisioned
4. **Health checks** verify everything is running
5. **Production URL** is assigned and activated
6. **24/7 monitoring** begins

**Estimated Time: 2-5 minutes**

---

## ✅ POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

### **Test Your Production Backend:**
```bash
# Replace with your actual production URL
curl https://YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL/categories

# Test user login
curl -X POST https://YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin&password=admin123"
```

### **Test Your Web Frontend:**
- Open: `https://YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL` in browser
- Login with admin credentials
- Check all pages load correctly
- Test creating an order
- Verify payments work (test mode)

---

## 📱 UPDATING YOUR MOBILE APP BUILD

After deployment, update your frontend environment variable:

### **Option A: Keep Current URL (Recommended for First Launch)**
```bash
# No change needed - your current URL already works
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://sweet-orders-8.preview.emergentagent.com
```

### **Option B: Use New Production URL**
If you get a new production URL after deployment:

1. **Update frontend/.env:**
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-new-production-url.emergentagent.com
```

2. **Rebuild your app:**
```bash
cd /app/frontend
npx eas build --platform android --profile production
```
