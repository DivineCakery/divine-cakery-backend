## 💡 Important URLs for Backend:

Your app currently uses:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://fresh-fix-portal.preview.emergentagent.com
```

**For Production Build:**
- Make sure your backend URL is stable and production-ready
- Update `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` in `.env` if needed
- The URL is baked into the build, so you'll need to rebuild if it changes

**A:** You can set up EAS Update for minor updates without rebuilding (separate service).
